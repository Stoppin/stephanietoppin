## Introduction 

In 1989, a pamphlet aimed to give voice to pro-choice reproductive rights through the lense of African American women. We Remember: African American Women are for Reproductive Freedom was signed by 16 prominent black women from major organizations including politicians, clergy, activists, and educators across the United States and in 1994 was reissued with additional signatures and support. The purpose of this site is to highlight this document in its original form through analysis, bring light to those that penned their name in support, and to emphasize (without speaking for) this printed work and its mission to a current digital audience. 

Some features of the document may seem dated, but it is not outdated. For those that fight in large and everyday ways for reproductive rights, for those that advocate for women of color, the document and similar print material display the length and extent of the fight that continues. Two truths can exists simultaneously; much progress has been made since the creation of We Remember in 1989 and little has changed. For black women, for marginalized groups, these truths are constant. 

## Why This Document?

This is not simply history. Reproductive rights are still being debated and as of May 2019, Roe v. Wade is being challenged throughout the United States. Signers of the document like Faye Wattleton, the first African American, the youngest president ever elected of Planned Parenthood, and US Representative Congresswoman Maxine Waters are still engaged in defending reproductive choice at the national scale. They and many others have committed their lives to racial and gender justice and discovering We Remember from 1989 should only add weight to modern campaigns such as #TrustBlackWomen. 

The first time I came across an old political pamphlet, different but similar to this one, I printed it out, stapled and trimmed the corners, I held it in my hands and read what still felt so very effective. Decades removed, I was informed and inspired; in a few, clear words I could articulate what moved me, follow the argument and logic, and now pass this on to others whether physically in print or verbally. What changes when we learn how old our fights are? How similar are protests are? When we take into account various forms of combating an issue? 

## Historical Context

“Shortness is a pamphlet’s strength” (Foreman). 

We Remember addressed racial and gender justice in a small handout, a black and white six-page pamphlet with an initial print of 250,000 copies (Whaley). Examining the form of print material, the pamphlet, adds insight into the documents impact. In Protest on the Page: Essays on Print and the Culture of Dissent Since 1865, a pamphlet is described as: 

>“Pamphlets are small, unbound, paper booklets with stitched, glued, or stapled spines, usually with one signature and consisting of sheets of paper folded in half. Popular from the fifteenth through the twentieth century, pamphlets have long been effective and inexpensive ways to distribute printed material” (Baughman, et al. 89).

The cheap and easy distribution of pamphlets coupled it with a history of protest against oppression as well as a source for community organizing and education. Bypassing editors and the cost of print ads, the pamphlet can be personally made and shared, ideas can be formalized and spread. Throughout history, pamphlets have acted as the accessible catalyst to the Reformation, to revolution, to change, to propaganda, to spreading ideas quickly, persuasively, and passionately (Foreman). A spark easily shared. Even though brief when compared to a book or newspaper, the pamphlet of a few pages was still long enough to be “one of the most suitable forms of disposable literature for presenting and sustaining in-depth arguments, histories and narratives” and could “reach people of varying literacy levels” (Baughman, et al. 91). 

What was happening during that time? Similar to 2019, 1989 abortion access was being restricted. The Supreme Court ruled in support of Webster v. Reproductive Health Services that states had the right to limit abortion access (Whaley). The Women’s Movement and Civil Rights movements had helped to support, but not fully voice the specific intersection of black women on this subject. The 16 women the came together in support of the words penned by editor Marcia Gillespie, wanted the perspectives of African American women to be heard in the debate for reproductive rights. The statement was printed and distributed at public events and venues. 

## The Adaptation

![My Adaptation](https://i.imgur.com/STXZfEh.png)
Print material adapted to website.

The above image is a sketch of the We Remember pamphlet adapted to a website that retains the document’s original content and transforms the text into an e-text that can be read, shared, supported, and commented on. The social portion of the adaptation includes a place for visitors, specifically black women and those in support of reproductive freedom, to sign their name along with the original signatures. There are also three pages where visitors can finish a prompt inspired by the text. Throughout the document, there are instances of sentences that start with the same phrase, such as: 

“Somebody said that we were less than human and not fit for freedom. Somebody said we were like children and could not be trusted to think for ourselves...Somebody said the Black women could be raped, held in concubinage, forced to bear children year in and year out, but often not raise them.”

The repetition helps to reinforce the message in a brief yet lasting way. “Somebody said…”, “The women who…”, and “We remember…” are prompts to continue sharing perspectives, stories, and highlight the voices of black women for black women. It would hopefully create the kind of inclusive environment to involve audience that might shy away from the subject. 

From the perspective of author Adam Hammond in “Digital Editions and the Complexity of Remediations”, Hammond might argue whether or not a piece of printed literature should be converted to a digital format or remediated, and while there is an argument to say that any document changing mediums loses some of its original intent, the brevity, affordability, portability, range or reach, and ease of sharing a pamphlet is extended in a digital format. What is lost may be the personal touch of human contact, of handing a piece of literature to a community member or acquaintance while fielding questions, or the back and forth of a conversation. The ease of sharing digitally becomes so easy that the content may be overlooked or skimmed, heaped under the infinite scroll of internet content. 

This kind of adaptation is a transposition from print to digital, but it also serves as commentary. While the document could be fully adapted to the present day, with new full color images and video content, visitors might not know the origins of the content and assume the message new. Retaining the look of the document, the simplicity, and the date, would help to show the length of the struggle, the progress, and continuation of the fight for reproductive freedom. 

### Formal Qualities 

The adaptation retains the off-white coloring of the paper with the content in black. The document at first glance may seem dated to current audience and the site hopefully does not downplay that detail. The first four pages of the document are each given a website page. The first centers the cover to quickly focus the visitor. The next page starts with the original text at left and aligns the commentary on the right. The three pages of the text alternate in alignment to subtly indicate to the visitor that they are now on a different page. The last webpage fills the screen with the last two pages of the document. The numbered list defining reproductive freedom is placed to the left. The signature page is placed on the right. The empty space on the original document under the last signature has the added area for the visitor to add their name. 

While the document has been changed, the final layout should feel similar to a magazine layout. The bold font of the prompts may pull the visitor’s eye, but it should not overshadow the document. The comments and signatures from visitors will mimic the same font of the document to provide a cohesive digital piece. The visitor would be able to scroll through the comments. While greater differentiation could be highlighted between the two areas, both are vital and one is not greater than the other. Individual women’s thoughts and personal experiences are side-by-side with the efforts of caucuses, politicians, educators, etc. This adaptation is specific to desktop or laptop computer and would need to be adapted for mobile use. 

### Cultural Meaning

Without the specific voices of black women, assumptions can be made about their views and perspective on reproductive rights. Either they are simply women’s rights without a racial lense, or perhaps the issue pales in comparison to racial justice, or moreso, the black community is far too conservative or concerned with black genocide to support reproductive freedom. These ideas become myth, a term used by theorist Ronald Barthes, and these further become norms although they are not natural, but are in so many ways culturally specific (Sturken and Cartwright 20). By writing We Remember and giving voice to a pro-choice view, the signers aimed to clearly articulate and dispel myths and perhaps create space for more women than shared their view. Since myth is influential in its unspokenness, acting as “connotations parading as denotations”, the 16 supporting women named the issue and did not want to create a negotiated space with the audience left to interpretation (22, 57). Yet, it can be said, from the perspective of African American women, the writer's words, spoken by people that share a portion of their identity and spoken to them, could invite black women to negotiate and interpret. Although it aims to clearly side with reproductive freedom, an argument is made to appeal to the black women and see her part in this debate. How she sees herself within that space, how it is interpreted and defined by her perspective, only adds to the weight of the discussion. 

## Rhetorical Significance 

We Remember aimed to make a statement and take a stand, to be heard by those with political power and everyday people, but it, as a political pamphlet, hoped to engage an audience and evoke a response, whether in support, against, or undecided. The women in support of the document spoke through an African American women’s perspective and directly spoke about the black community and issues faced by black women. This document and adaptation can inform outsiders, but to those that are insiders, hopes to create a liberating text, as philosopher Slavoj Žižek mentions, that black women may struggle with, debate, or feel affirmed by the ideology.   

I hope this adaptation creates a space for black women. It may first appeal to those that are already pro-choice and are perhaps activists, but out of that group I hope it expands to black women that may differ, but that care about black women’s health and their voices that may get drowned out or ignored by groups that only tailor to black people or to women’s rights. I hope the intersection of these identities affords space for transgender men. While the medium is digital, meaning that those who are not as proficient with technology may not be drawn to the space, I hope the tone continues a conversation in plain, everyday language so that discussions do not create greater barriers to entry. I hope it encourages longer more thoughtful discussion.

## Reflection 

If an audience outside of this class, if the intended audience of black women, of women like my mom, where to see this site, I hope there would be enough there to make them stay. I hope the image gripped them enough to read on and if they think of an artist, I hope they think more about the original composers of the document, than the website itself. They may initially wonder what is the purpose of the website before seeing the signing page or prompts to share, but eventually they would wonder about me, my identity, my intent. I don’t think there is a way to discuss reproductive rights without people wondering if their stories and names are safe with the person that has reached out to them. 

With unlimited resources, this would be the start of an interactive archive, but also a resource to encourage persons to print, read, and share these documents. Outside of the classroom, this project applies to a greater audience involved in the debate for reproductive rights. Hopefully it would have a place to support and create space for dialogue “to incite discussion and open up spaces to imagine new and radical futures” (Baughman et al 91).

When using material from an archive, while it may hold historical weight, the work may be viewed as regressive, more a applicable to a time and place and not necessarily as progressive. And yet, to examine the past and present it again, is a kind of stubborn hope because it combines the “as per my last email” tone with the determination that something will come of this exchange. The idea of a pamphlet is to be shared more than it is for profit. Inexpensive to completely free, people share upcoming events, drawings, ideas, etc and strive to provide a small education or a spark of inspiration. To create a small print material is to be incredibly hopeful, to believe in the power of communication and possibility.
